# How to get the results?

In order to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers as well as the confidentiality of the data presented, this repository is private and is shared via GitFront. Thus, its size cannot exceed 100 Mb, so the date for the results are accessible at the [following Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hefnnkap5f6pq3q/AAAFnrtEzbLUE15z8zJaUAtYa?dl=0) and will be made available on this repository once the peer-review process is completed.

# Description

Two types of results are provided with our simulations:
- Cost-benefit simulations results:
  - Monte Carlo simulation `resultsMC.xlsx`
  - Robust simulation `resultsRobust.xlsx`.
- Cost-effective simulations with a target results:
  - Monte Carlo simulation in which reaching a given `target` at a certain `level` is constrained is featured in the file  `resultsMCleveltarget.xlsx`. For instance, the results for the Monte Carlo simulation with a constraint at +2°C compared to the pre-industrial era are in the file `resultsMC2deg.xlsx`
  - Robust simulations in which reaching a given `target` at a certain `level` is limited to a some `probability` is featured in the file `resultsleveltargetprobability.xlsx`. For example, the results for the robust trajectory limiting sea-level rise speed to 5.0 mm.yr-1 wiht probability 0.66 are given in the file `results50SLRdot66.xlsx`
