# Description

Two types of results are provided with our simulations:
- Cost-benefit simulations results:
  - Monte Carlo simulation `resultsMC.xlsx`
  - Robust simulation `resultsRobust.xlsx`.
- Cost-effective simulations with a target results:
  - Monte Carlo simulation in which reaching a given `target` at a certain `level` is constrained is featured in the file  `resultsMCleveltarget.xlsx`. For instance, the results for the Monte Carlo simulation with a constraint at +2°C compared to the pre-industrial era are in the file `resultsMC2deg.xlsx`
  - Robust simulations in which reaching a given `target` at a certain `level` is limited to a some `probability` is featured in the file `resultsleveltargetprobability.xlsx`. For example, the results for the robust trajectory limiting sea-level rise speed to 5.0 mm.yr-1 wiht probability 0.66 are given in the file `results50SLRdot66.xlsx`
